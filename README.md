# Keli Native Client

Keli Native Client is the new Rust-first client workspace for the Keli stack.
It is not a port of the existing Flutter client. The first milestone focuses on
the client core, native proxy core boundaries, diagnostics, and a CLI harness
before any full desktop UI is built.

## First Milestone

- Rust workspace and crate boundaries.
- Client business state machine.
- Native proxy core routing and inbound/outbound abstractions.
- Protocol profile validation, subscription parsing, and local relay coverage for
  the current Keli native protocol set.
- Platform capability boundaries for Windows-first development.
- CLI doctor command for smoke verification.

## Protocol Matrix

The client protocol set is aligned with `keli-core-rs/src/protocol.rs`.

| Protocol | TCP relay | UDP relay | Covered transports |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Trojan | yes | yes | TCP, WS, HTTPUpgrade, gRPC, H2, QUIC |
| VLESS | yes | yes | TCP, WS, HTTPUpgrade, gRPC, H2, QUIC |
| VMess | yes | yes | TCP, WS, HTTPUpgrade, gRPC, H2, QUIC |
| Shadowsocks | yes | yes | AEAD TCP profile with UDP relay |
| AnyTLS | yes | yes | TLS TCP, UoT UDP |
| Naive | yes | no | H2 TCP, H3 QUIC |
| Mieru | yes | yes | TCP profile, port-range subscription parsing |
| HY2 | yes | yes | QUIC |
| TUIC | yes | yes | QUIC |
| SOCKS5 outbound | yes | yes | TCP, UDP associate |
| HTTP outbound | yes | no | HTTP CONNECT |

Both Mihomo YAML and share-link subscriptions have parser and registry matrix
tests for these protocols. `keli-cli doctor` prints the authoritative runtime
capability list.

## Design Principles

- Learn protocol and transport separation from Xray.
- Learn client DNS, TUN, route, and mixed inbound behavior from sing-box.
- Use Rust for strong typed configuration, explicit state machines, bounded
  resources, deterministic tests, and safe long-running behavior.
- Keep Keli-specific behavior in first-class models: panel state, node health,
  risk control, and support diagnostics.

## Verify

```powershell
cargo fmt --check
$env:CARGO_INCREMENTAL='0'; cargo test --workspace -j 1
cargo run -p keli-cli -- doctor
```
